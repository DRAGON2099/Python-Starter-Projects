def rules():
    print('''The Rules are simple and are as follows :- 
    
    You choose to Toss, Bat First, Bowl First.
    You choose the number of wickets to play with.
    You try to score more runs than the Cpu and that decides the winner.
    Im allowing both sides to score as much runs instead of ending when the run score is reached for fun.
    Most Importantly Have fun!!''')
